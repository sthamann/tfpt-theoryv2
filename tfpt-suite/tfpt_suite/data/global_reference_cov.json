Until a publication-grade PDG/CODATA covariance is supplied, we treat the matrix as diagonal and add a conservative theory-floor on alpha_inv_0 to avoid over-interpreting a ppb-level residual as a 'theory failure' in composite scorecards. The strict per-observable z-scores in global_reference.json remain unchanged; this file is used only for an auxiliary covariance-based gate.",
