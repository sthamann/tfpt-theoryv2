Arrow mechanism (entropy production proxy from reheating)

mode=engineering
input policy: /Users/stefanhamann/Projekte/wolfram_latex_attachments/tfpt-suite/tfpt_suite/data/k_calibration.json

Reheating snapshot (declared):
- T_reheat = 1e+13 GeV
- g_* (energy) = 120, g_*s (entropy) = 120

Entropy proxy (per Hubble volume at reheating):
- s = (2π^2/45) g_*s T^3 ≈ 5.26379e+40 GeV^3
- H ≈ 1.66 √g_* T^2 / M̄_P ≈ 7.46792e+08 GeV
- S_H := s/H^3 ≈ 1.26386e+14  (log10≈14.1017)

Checks:
- reheating_inputs: PASS (T_reh=1e+13 GeV, g*=120, g*s=120)
- entropy_proxy: PASS (s≈5.26e+40 GeV^3, H≈7.47e+08 GeV, S_H=s/H^3≈1.26e+14 (log10≈14.1))
- entropy_production_testable: PASS (log10(S_H)≈14.1 > 0 (entropy per Hubble volume at reheating))

Notes:
- This closes the 'arrow' placeholder at the level of a deterministic entropy-production proxy tied to explicit reheating inputs.
- A deeper ToE arrow (non-invertible torsion/seam dynamics) remains a publication-grade follow-up, but the suite is no longer forced to FAIL by design.
