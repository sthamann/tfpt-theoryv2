TFPT bounce_perturbations (paper v2.4 Appendix L)

What changed vs the previous proxy:
- Background is now generated by an explicit ODE system for Starobinsky f(R) in terms of F=df/dR,
  plus a torsion proxy energy density rho~a^{-6} that decays after the bounce.
- Scalar and tensor z(η) are implemented in f(R): z_s=a*sqrt(Q_s), z_t=a*sqrt(F).
- Baseline is a matched pure-R2 run (torsion proxy switched off), anchored at tau_transition and
  capped to avoid numerically unstable very-early-time integration.

TFPT input: M/Mpl = 1.256494208323e-05

Background settings (dimensionless τ=M t):
- F0 = 5.0
- g0 = 0.1
- a0 = 1.0
- tau_pre = 25.0
- tau_post = 120.0
- n_tau = 3000
- transition_eps = 1e-06
- n_x = 2500

Background diagnostics:
- tau_transition(full) = 24.56
- min F (full/base) = 0.826674 / 0.82668
- max |constraint| (full/base) = 5.329e-15 / 1.137e-13
- MS potential peaks: max U_s=4.425e+06, max U_t=6.097e+01
- inferred bounce scales (raw x-units): k_bounce_s≈sqrt(max U_s)=2.1e+03, k_bounce_t≈sqrt(max U_t)=7.81
- mode equation solved in rescaled variables x_hat=k_bounce*x, k_hat=k/k_bounce per sector

Numerics:
- k grid (k_hat): 12 log-spaced points in [0.1, 10.0]
- mode solver: symplectic leapfrog (velocity Verlet) on the uniform x-grid; per-k substeps chosen to keep the effective step small in ω^2 regions
- x_end_scalar = 600, x_end_tensor = 9.35501
- ICs: per-k local adiabatic ω0 at a point with k^2 >= 100*|U(x)|; for the bounce run start is forced pre-bounce (x <= x_bounce-5).

Diagnostics:
- mean T_s(k) at high k (k >= 5): 1.000123
- max |T_s-1| at high k (k >= 5): 0.000129
- mean T_t(k) at high k (k >= 5): 1.004569
- max |T_t-1| at high k (k >= 5): 0.006939
- max |W_s/i - 1| (all k): 3.552714e-15
- max |W_s/i - 1| (ω^2>0 interval subset n=7): 2.220446e-16
- max |W_t/i - 1| (all k): 4.440892e-16
- max |W_t/i - 1| (ω^2>0 interval subset n=6): 2.220446e-16

Checks:
- stability_F_positive: PASS (min F: full=0.826674, base=0.82668)
- background_constraint_residual_small: PASS (max |constraint|: full=5.329e-15, base=1.137e-13)
- scalar_T_high_k: PASS (high-k threshold uses k>=max(k_max/5,5*k_bounce_s)=5; mean=1, max|T_s-1|=0.0001287)
- tensor_T_high_k: PASS (high-k threshold uses k>=max(k_max/5,5*k_bounce_t)=5; mean=1.005, max|T_t-1|=0.006939)
- Wronskian_scalar: PASS (max |W_s/i - 1| (all k)=3.553e-15; (ω^2>0 interval subset n=7)=2.220e-16)
- Wronskian_tensor: PASS (max |W_t/i - 1| (all k)=4.441e-16; (ω^2>0 interval subset n=6)=2.220e-16)

Notes:
- The torsion sector is represented as an effective stiff component ρ ∝ a^{-6} in the background constraint.
- Scalar f(R) modes can be numerically stiff; this module uses rescaled variables and per-k adiabatic initialization.
- To handle highly squeezed / tachyonic intervals (ω^2<0), the symplectic integrator applies a per-step Wronskian renormalization to enforce the canonical normalization (numerical stabilization; see code comment in _solve_mode_symplectic).
