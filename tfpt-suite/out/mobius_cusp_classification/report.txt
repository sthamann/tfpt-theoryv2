Möbius cusp classification (bounded rational search; paper v2.4 constraints)

Goal:
- Deterministically confirm the cusp-set uniqueness claim stated in the TFPT v2.4 TeX.

Holonomy → cusp rule model (explicit input):
- holonomy group: SU(5)
- generator: Y (hypercharge, fundamental)
- eigenvalues (fund): [Fraction(-1, 3), Fraction(-1, 3), Fraction(-1, 3), Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(1, 2)]
- derived cusp magnitudes: [Fraction(1, 3), Fraction(2, 3), Fraction(1, 1)]

Constraints implemented (paper v2.4):
- boundary holonomy quantization => rational cusps
- SU(5) hypercharge compatibility => cusp magnitudes from the holonomy spectrum
- sector separation: y=1 (leptons), y=1/3 (down-type), y=2/3 (up-type)
- quotient by S3 permutations only (unordered cusp-set)

max_den=3: candidates=1, canonical_classes=1
  canonical reps: [('1/3', '2/3', '1')]
max_den=6: candidates=1, canonical_classes=1
  canonical reps: [('1/3', '2/3', '1')]
max_den=12: candidates=1, canonical_classes=1
  canonical reps: [('1/3', '2/3', '1')]
max_den=24: candidates=1, canonical_classes=1
  canonical reps: [('1/3', '2/3', '1')]

Checks:
- holonomy_hypercharge_rule_system_derived_and_encoded: PASS (derived cusp magnitudes from SU(5) hypercharge: [Fraction(1, 3), Fraction(2, 3), Fraction(1, 1)])
- stable_unique_class_all_bounds: PASS (canonical_classes == 1 for max_den in {3,6,12,24})
- rep_matches_paper_triplet: PASS (representative matches {1,1/3,2/3} (paper v2.4))

Notes:
- This module encodes the paper's cusp constraints exactly; it is no longer using the earlier '1/3 gaps' proxy.
- If you want a more adversarial test, extend the constraint set and show uniqueness still holds under that larger rule system.
