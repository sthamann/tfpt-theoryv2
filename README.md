Topological Fixed Point Theory (TFPT) derives the fine structure constant and related observables from topology, geometry and quantum consistency alone. Using a small set of axioms, it yields a unique cubic fixed point for α with sub ppm accuracy, predicts cosmic birefringence, and organizes physical scales without free parameters.
