# Topological Fixed Point Theory (TFPT)

Topological Fixed Point Theory (TFPT) is a principled framework that aims to derive fundamental physical constants and scales from topology, geometry and minimal consistency requirements. Instead of importing measured values, TFPT seeks mathematically inevitable solutions that match empirical data with high precision.

The core insight is that certain physical parameters emerge as fixed points of topological and geometric constraints when embedded in a consistent quantum framework. This approach yields a unique cubic equation for the fine-structure constant α and organizes hierarchies of scales without free parameters.

TFPT builds on concepts from high-dimensional geometry, fixed point mathematics, and renormalization group logic to reveal the deep structural roots of physical observables. The theory’s development and validation are documented in the accompanying publication.

## Key Features

- **Parameter minimalism:** Derives constants from structural principles.
- **Cubic fixed points:** Unique solutions for α and related quantities.
- **Geometric underpinning:** Uses topological and symmetry arguments.
- **Empirical contact:** Predictions align with measured values within tight tolerances.
